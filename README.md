# Destiny 2 OAuth Example

This application is a sample app that shows off how you can implement OAuth authentication for iOS + SwiftUI. This applications is by no means a representation of best practices using Swift UI or The Composable Architecture. This is simple something I've cobbled together for an app I'm working on.

I chose to share this since resources and documentation aren't the greatest when it comes to dealing with the Destiny 2 API. So I hope this helps inspire you to build an app for the Destiny 2 community.

## Important Components used

This app makes use of two major things, [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) and The [composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). If the code doesn't make too much sence you can cut right to the implementation and look at the meat and potatoes in the [Destiny2Client](https://github.com/etiennemartin/destiny2-oauth-example/blob/main/Destiny2-OAuth/Destiny2Client/Destiny2Client.swift#L68) implementation.

## Issues or Questions?

If you have any issues, comments or additions you would love to add to the app, feel free to open an issue or post a PR. Contributions are welcome!
